# ESP32 WiFi Scanner Lab

For this lab, I used the ESP32-CAM and the built-in WiFiScan example sketch to detect and list nearby wireless networks. 


## Set It Up

1. Opened Arduino IDE and selected:
   
2. Made sure my board was set to: `AI Thinker ESP32-CAM`
3. Connected the ESP32-CAM to my FTDI programmer (with IO0 to GND for upload mode)
4. Uploaded the sketch to the board
5. Removed IO0 from GND and pressed the reset button
6. Opened the Serial Monitor at `115200` baud to view the scan results


The Serial Monitor displayed all nearby Wi-Fi networks. Each line showed the SSID, signal strength in dBm, channel number, and the type of encryption used (like WPA2 or Open). The results refreshed every 10 seconds.


## What I Learned

This lab showed how easy it is to use the ESP32-CAM to analyze wireless environments. It helped me better understand what kind of information is broadcast by networks and why that matters in cybersecurity.
